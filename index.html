            <h1>Min3D</h1>

            A project to explore 3d rendering in javascript using the cpu only (*). Generally speaking all of this is an exceptionally bad idea, but it's fun. Probably.

            <ul>
                <li><a href="scripts/version1/index.html">Version 1:</a> the bare minimal implementation needed to render a mesh onto the screen.</li>
            </ul>

            (*) except for those parts under the hood where the canvas implementation uses the gpu, but those factors are not under our control.
